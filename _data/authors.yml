    Hi!
    I'm a Computer Science student, about to graduating in June 2021 as a Bachelor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil.
    I've explored a broad range of areas throught my undergrad years but I have to say that computer graphics and machine learning
    (specially the interssection between both!) is what brighthens my eyes the most.
    By taking part of internship programs I realized how important is to consider scalability, performance and reliability when
    designing and implementing an application, so I've been focusing on studying cloud computing (AWS and Azure), parallelization and distributed infrastucture.
    I'm looking foward to where my career will take me! I value beeing able to constantly learn from my peers and workplaces where I can write quality code.
