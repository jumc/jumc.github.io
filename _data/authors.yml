    Hi!
    I'm a **Computer Science** student, graduating in **June 2021** as a Bachelor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil.

    My main interests are **computer graphics** and **machine learning** (specially the interssection between both!). I quite like **back-end development** as well.
    By taking part of internship programs I realized how important is to consider scalability, performance and reliability when
    designing and implementing an application, so I've been focusing on studying cloud computing (AWS and Azure), parallelization and distributed infrastucture.
    On my free time I love playing boardgames, reading sci-fi and creating illustrations.

    I'm looking foward to where my career will take me! I value beeing able to constantly learn from my peers and workplaces where I can write quality code.
